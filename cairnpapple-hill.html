      which was a collection       8888888+                   +                     +          and slowly climbed up                                        
      of tumulus researches        8888888+                      +   +     *    .+               and the wind welcomed us.                                  
  from a conferance in istanbul.   8888888+                          +  +  +                       the wind is always there in Scotland.

                                    88888 +  this time we got much closer.                         they made their way underneath my short                  
                                  :  888  +         ++                +                          and gave my whole body a big hug.                          
i walked around the tumulus multiple times +         +                                        that was too much.  shaked me up.  freezing.                  
                   and different direction.    somehow we could struggle a little bit                                                                       
                                                  with the overwind condition.                my hands were shaking.                                        
   i could make some recording                                                                 honestly, at that moment,                                    
       with the gopro that i borrowed from TSD-GSA                                               i didn't know what i was doing anymore.                    
                                     just for a week.                                                                                                       
                                                        i just had a great time with the whole challenge.                                                   
                                                         we realised that the tumulus has interior artifact                                                 
                                                            that we could visit inside but it was closed                                                    
                                                                                                                                                            
                           through out the history                                                                                                          
             Cairnpapple tumulus has been manipulated multiple times.                                                                                       
                         it is too much manipulation!

                                                                                               when the wind is on leave.

        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
